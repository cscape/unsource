# Unsource ✨

This package lets you extract original source code from a sourcemap. Since sourcemaps are language-agnostic, this works with any valid sourcemap.

## Usage

Place a sourcemap into the root directory of this project. Title it `mapping.js.map`. Then start the script:

```bash
npm start
```
